# PS2HD - Who dis?

PS2HD is the PlayStation 2 emulator used in the official classic games releases on PS4 and PS5. It is part of a suite of emulators that Sony has built over the past decade for bringing their classic games back to modern platforms - PS1HD, PSPHD, and PS2HD.  

The emulator includes extensive support for altering the games at runtime via a LUA based scripting system. Some of the functions are [documented on the PS4 Developer Wiki](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/PS2_Emulation#XXXX-YYYYY_config.lua).  

This directory contains an extract of the cutscene skip functionality which was included in the LUA script files for the Sly 2 release on PS4.
